        Please read the Terms of Service (“Terms”), a legal contract which
        governs your use of Ko-dev, including any content, functionality, and
        services offered on or through Ko-dev. Please pay special attention to
        the following sections: disclaimer of warranties; limitations of
        liability; releases; class action waiver, mandatory arbitration, and
        disputes. By registering with and using Ko-dev, you hereby accept and

        We may change these Terms on one or more occasions. Changes will become

        Changes will not apply to continuing disputes or to disputes arising out
        of (or relating to) events happening before the posted changes. While
        the Company will try to notify you when the Company changes these Terms,
        the Company does not assume an obligation to do so, and it is your

        agreement. By continuing to use Ko-dev after the Company posts changes
        to these Terms, you agree to the revised agreement. If you do not agree
        to the revised agreement, your exclusive remedy is to stop accessing
        Ko-dev.

              your listed payment card for the full amount of that purchase.
              Typically, funds stored in your wallet are non-refundable;

              <u>Indemnification Provision:</u> You will pay the Company, its
              subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, service providers, content
              providers, employees, agents, officers, directors, and contractors
              (the “Indemnified Parties”) for any loss of the Indemnified
              Parties’ that is caused by any of the following: your access of
              Ko-dev; your conduct on Ko-dev, including any content you
              submit to Ko-dev; your breach of these Terms; your actual or
              alleged violation of rights of any person, including intellectual
              property and privacy rights; your actual or alleged violation of
              any law; your actual or alleged negligent, fraudulent, or
              intentional conduct; or your actual or alleged criminal conduct.
              But you are not required to pay if the loss was caused by the
              Indemnified Parties’ intentional misconduct.

          <li>
            <p>
              <u>Definitions Related to Indemnification:</u>
              “Loss” means an amount that the Indemnified Parties are legally
              responsible for or pay in any form. Amounts include, for example,
              a judgment, a settlement, a fine, damages, injunctive relief,
              staff compensation, a decrease in property value, and expenses for
              defending against a claim for a loss (including fees for legal
              counsel, expert witnesses, and other advisers). A loss can be
              tangible or intangible; can arise from bodily injury, property
              damage, or other causes; can be based on tort, breach of contract,
              or any other theory of recovery; and includes incidental, direct,
              and consequential damages. A loss is “caused by” an event if the
              loss would not have happened without the event, even if the event
              is not a proximate cause of the loss.

          <li>
            <p>
              <u>Indemnified Parties’ Duty to Notify You:</u>
              If the Indemnified Party has your contact information, the
              Indemnified Party will notify you before the 30th day after the
              Indemnified Party knows or should reasonably have known of a claim
              for a loss that you might be compelled to pay. But the Indemnified
              Party’s failure to give you timely notice does not end your
              obligation, except if that failure prejudices your ability to
              defend or mitigate losses.

          <li>
            <p>
              <u>Legal Defense of a Claim:</u> The Indemnified Party has control
              over defending a claim for a loss (including settling it), unless
              the Indemnified Party directs you to control the defense. If the
              Indemnified Party directs you to control the defense, you will not
              settle any litigation without the Indemnified Party’s written
              consent if the settlement (1) imposes a penalty or limitation on
              the Indemnified Party, (2) admits the Indemnified Party’s fault,
              or (3) does not fully release the Indemnified Party from
              liability. You and the Indemnified Party will cooperate with each
              other in good faith on a claim.

              <u>Governing Law:</u> The laws of the state of Florida—without
              giving effect to any conflicts of law principles—govern all
              matters arising out of your use of Ko-dev or relating in any way
              to these Terms. The predominant purpose of these Terms is
              providing services and licensing access to intellectual property
              and is not a “sale of goods.” These Terms will not be governed by
              the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
              Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.
              Except for disputes subject to arbitration, all disputes arising
              out of or relating to Ko-dev or these Terms will be subject to
              the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal
              courts located in Orange County, Florida. Each party hereby
              submits to the personal jurisdiction of the Florida courts located
              in Orange County, Florida to resolve all disputes not subject to
              arbitration. Each party hereby waives any right to seek another
              forum or venue because of improper or inconvenient forum. For
              purposes of this section, Ko-dev will be deemed solely based in
              the state of Florida and will be deemed a passive website that
              does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over the Company,
              either specific or general, in any other jurisdiction.

              <u>Dispute Resolution:</u> Each party will allow the other a
              reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other
              has not met the duties under these Terms. The parties will first
              meet and negotiate with each other in good faith to try to resolve
              all disputes between the parties arising out of or relating to
              Ko-dev or these Terms.

              <u>Litigation Election:</u> Either party may elect to litigate the
              following type of case or controversy: (a) an action seeking
              injunctive relief, or (b) a suit to compel compliance with this
              dispute resolution process.

          <li>

              <u>Mediation:</u> If the parties cannot settle a dispute arising
              out of or relating to Ko-dev or these Terms through negotiation
              after thirty (30) days, either party may, by notice to the other
              party demand that the dispute be mediated by a certified mediator
              in the state of Florida. If the parties cannot agree upon a
              mediator within thirty (30) days, the parties may submit the
              dispute to arbitration or litigation as otherwise provided in
              these Terms. Mediation will take place in Orange County, Florida,
              or in such other location as the parties mutually agree. The
              language of the mediation will be English. Each party will bear
              its own costs in mediation, and the parties will share equally
              between them all third-party mediation costs unless the parties
              agree differently in writing. Each party will participate actively
              and constructively in mediation proceedings once started and will
              attend at least one joint meeting between the mediator and the
              parties. Any party may terminate mediation at any time after an
              initial meeting between the mediator and the parties.

              <u>Arbitration:</u> If the parties cannot settle a dispute through
              mediation, the parties will settle any unresolved dispute arising
              out of or relating to Ko-dev or these Terms by arbitration
              administered by American Arbitration Association in accordance
              with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. A single arbitrator will
              preside over the arbitration. The arbitrator, and not any federal,
              state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to
              resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the
              interpretation, enforceability, or formation of these Terms,
              including any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or
              voidable. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitration will
              take place in Orange County, Florida. Each party will be
              responsible for paying any filing, administrative, and arbitrator
              fees associated with the arbitration. The arbitrator may grant
              whatever relief that would be available in a court at law or in
              equity, except that the arbitrator must not award punitive or
              exemplary damages, or damages otherwise limited or excluded in
              these Terms. The arbitrator’s award will include costs of
              arbitration, reasonable legal fees, and reasonable costs for
              expert and other witnesses. The arbitrator’s award will be binding
              on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of
              competent jurisdiction. Unless required by law, neither a party
              nor an arbitrator will disclose the existence, content, or results
              of any arbitration under these Terms without the advance written
              consent of both parties.

              <u>Right to Injunctive Relief:</u>
              Nothing in this section will prevent either party from seeking
              injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters
              related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized
              access to Ko-dev.

              <u>Recovery of Expenses:</u> In any proceedings between the
              parties arising out of these Terms or relating to the subject
              matter of these Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to
              recover from the other party, besides any other relief awarded,
              all expenses that the prevailing party incurs in those
              proceedings, including legal fees and expenses. “Prevailing party”
              means, for any proceeding, the party in whose favor an award is
              rendered, except that if in those proceedings the award finds in
              favor of one party on one or more claims or counterclaims and in
              favor of the other party on one or more other claims or
              counterclaims, neither party will be the prevailing party. If any
              proceedings are voluntarily dismissed or are dismissed as part of
              settlement of that dispute, neither party will be the prevailing
              party in those proceedings.

              <u>Jury Trial Waiver:</u> Both parties hereby waive the right to a
              trial by jury for any dispute arising out of or relating to
              Ko-dev or these Terms. Either party may enforce this waiver up
              to and including the first day of trial.

              <u>Class Action Waiver:</u> All claims must be brought in the
              parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class
              member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and,
              unless the Company agrees otherwise, the arbitrator will not
              consolidate more than one person’s claims. Both parties
              acknowledge that each party is waiving the right to participate in
              a class action.

              <u>Limitation on Time to Bring Claims:</u>A party will not file a
              claim arising out of or relating to Ko-dev or these Terms more
              than one year after the cause of action arose. Any claim brought
              after one year is barred.

              <u>Entire Agreement:</u> These Terms constitute the entire
              agreement between you and the Company about your access to
              Ko-dev. It supersedes all earlier or contemporaneous agreements
              between you and the Company about access to Ko-dev. A printed
              version of this agreement will be admissible in any proceedings
              arising out of (or relating to) these Terms to the same extent and
              subject to the same conditions as other business documents and
              records originally generated and kept in printed form. Any
              additional terms on Ko-dev will govern the items to which they
              pertain.

              consent. You will not assign your rights or delegate your
              performance under this agreement without the Company’s advanced
              written consent. Any attempted assignment of rights or delegation
              of performance in breach of this section is void.

              Terms only by a writing signed by the party or parties against
              whom the waiver is sought to be enforced. No failure or delay in
              exercising any right or remedy, or in requiring the satisfaction
              of any condition, under these Terms, and no act, omission, or
              course of dealing between the parties, operates as a waiver or
              estoppel of any right, remedy, or condition. A waiver made in
              writing on one occasion is effective only in that instance and
              only for the purpose stated. A waiver once given is not to be
              construed as a waiver on any future occasion or against any other
              person.
